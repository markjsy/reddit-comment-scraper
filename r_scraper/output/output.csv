I strongly recommend that anyone interested in following this President Trump story or US Politics watch S06E04, "Liftoff" and S06E05, "The Hubbert Peak". Even if you've never watched any other episodes, I think you can jump into these two without too much trouble. In this episode, the President names a new White House Chief of Staff, and we follow them around as they try to get up to speed with the job. There's really not much in the way of politics in the episodes - they're more day-to-day life, getting the job done, etc. I recommend them because you will be blown away at the concept of the quiet professionalism on display by the people involved. While this is just a TV show and they're just actors, it's not too hard to imagine that it's probably how most White House staffs operate. And it is in stark contrast to the bullshit and ineptitude we've seen leak out of the current White House. |

Of course he likes Sessions, then, right? lol  Trump even stuck with Cohn through his disbarment proceedings, when Cohn was hit with charges of fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation. And while Cohn was indeed disbarred in the end, it wasn't until Trump learned that Cohn had been diagnosed with AIDS that he decided to sever his ties with his mentor.These are the types of people we have governing one of the greatest nations ever on the face of the planet?

And an article at The Week (whatever that is) with the headline: Donald Trump turned his back on his closest friend when he heard he had AIDS (Warning: this one is a poor excuse for an article) So it does seem like he severed ties him towards the end, as a business associate anyway. Cohn died of complications from AIDS in 1986, smack in the middle of the AIDS scare, and I can definitely believe that Trump would drop him as a lawyer for his clients if he was diagnosed. Hell, look at Reagan's callous non-response to the outbreak. However, Cohn was also disbarred shortly before he died, so that may have been a factor as well. Note that Trump testified to the state bar at Cohn's hearing, saying: If I summed it up in one word ... I think the primary word Id use is his loyalty.NYTimesPoliticoThe Week|

Roy was brutal, but he was a very loyal guy, Trump told the writer Tim OBrien, in 2005. He brutalized for you.One of Seymours notes describes Cohns efforts to advance the judicial career of Trumps sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, who served as a federal appeals-court judge for decades, until stepping down soon after Trump assumed the Presidency: Roy got the White House to give her her judgeship, Seymour writes. Roy was out and the call came in to tell her she got it. I took the call and called her to tell her. Ten minutes later, Donald called to say thank you. They were so close, they talked at least several times a week, she said. And as soon as he found out [Cohn had AIDS], he took all his cases away from Roy except for one and got new lawyers. After all theyd been through together. http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/eavesdropping-on-roy-cohn-and-donald-trumpFun fact: Cohn is the guy who connected Trump with Roger Stone.

The average HIV transmission rate duringanal sexis estimated to be 18 times higher than the rate during vaginal intercourse, even with protection. Also, the role variability of gay men increasestransmission risk. Role variability refers to taking different "roles" during sexual encounters. Men who practice receptive, unprotected anal intercourse are at higher risk ofcontracting HIV. Men who practice insertive,unprotected anal intercourseare more likely to transmit HIV to their partners. This combination optimizes the spread of HIV between gay men in a way not seen in heterosexual couples. In heterosexual couples, men are far more likely to penetrate and women to be penetrated. Because of this, HIV is far more likely to spread from the male partner to the female partner than vice versa.|

I realize that you didn't say "liberals" here, but painting Trump supporters as reasonably turned off by the close mindedness of people who don't accept that lack of empathy is a good reason for voting someone in is almost the same thing. |

I can't remember which philosopher it was who said that misanthrops are optimistic people who become dissapointed because they expect better from the human race. While I don't go quite as far as optimistic, I think that a person can be misanthropic because they see that people are inherently selfish or just in general have rubbed them the wrong way their whole lives, and still lead by example and/or do good things in a philanthropic manner. Since opposites  cannot be the same thing, it stands to reason that misanthropy is not the opposite of philanthropy.  |

I'm only from Missouri and both Democrats and Republicans representing my state I am fine with, I think they are all solid leaders and I am very thankful to have Eric Greitens as my Governor and I think he will do wonders for my state.I can't talk for all my other fellow countrymen in the other 49 states who vote Republican because what works here in Missouri probably won't work in Texas or Wisconsin.Both sides are too blame for where we are as a nation. You guys had 8 years of Obama and I'll admit he did some good things and some bad things and I expect the same of Trump.I'm a Republican I am proud to say that and I wish both Democratic politicians and Republican politicians the best of luck into turning this country around while I may not support most of them I do hope them the best and I hope you do too.|

That is exactly why we have a two party system. Even if you hate the third party candidate and even know there's no chance of winning you're still making your voice heard to the federal govt that you want a third party and they will respond with federal funding. If politics is all about money, then one vote for a third party means more money whichs means your candidate has a greater chance of winning. |

This type of electoral system almost always becomes a system with two major parties. This is because the winner doesn't need to get a majority of votes, just more than the others. In such an electoral system, with three parties, you run the risk of, and frequently get, a winner who does not have the support of 2/3 of the voters. This was somewhat common in the early days of the US (though not really as much at the White House level) and smaller parties, tired of losing, found their similarities and common ideals and became larger parties. This is all just a reflection of DuVerger's Law. Now, all that said, there's nothing that requires two major parties, or even that these two parties are the two major parties. However, the main goal of a party is to win elections. If Democrats, for instance, continue losing support to Social Democrats, they will (likely) adopt more positions in the party platform to reflect that. Same for Republicans and more Libertarian groups. With a FPTP electoral system, third party votes may send a message to the major parties, but unless they can attract more votes than the two major parties, they will more often than not act as a spoiler. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law|

What you're more likely to see is the two major parties realign to newer positions. The Dems get a little more left, the GOP gets a little more right, maybe they drop the culture war stuff. The best thing a third party can do is to run at the local and state level and begin to affect policy there. Part of the reason no one votes for someone like the Green Party, as an example, is they show up once every four years, propose incredibly unrealistic policies - many of which would require a fundamental reinterpretation of a federal republic into a unitary parliamentary system - and then they fuck off for four years. If we really want a healthy multiparty system in the US, we need to change all the state and local electoral laws, and amend the Constitution to do away with the EC and to require an absolute majority for the White House, creating a system with a runoff vote. On a personal level, I think this sounds fucking awesome. But, it's really, really unlikely to happen.|

The idea that the only action he took was to push abstinence-only education and programs is a bold faced lie.  His presidency created the largest global health program in history to tackle a single disease.

And I felt like, while Bush made many poor decisions during his presidency, it was mostly due to him being mislead by advisors and not due to a lack of humanity.  He seemed to care about people and be passionate and I will always be grateful to him for the tremendous efforts he took to help children and those with HIV.

It has been one of the oldest propaganda tricks since the dawn of history, blaming shitty leadership on poor advisors.Well, in modern USA the Presidents get to choose their advisors and Presidents mostly delegate tasks anyway, so the majority of what they have to do is know who to listen to and when to listen to what. If they can't do that, what are they good for? It's like a bus driver who keeps crashing the bus but he's still a good driver because "he has really nice chats with me" to make an absurd, but still applicable imo example.Yeah, Bush Jr doesn't seem "evil". I have no idea how much good there is in him, but he had little problems following much of the GOP orthodoxy of helping the rich at the cost of the rest. Let's not allow Trump to make Bush a good guy. A lot of people try to make themselves look moderate by complimenting certain leaders of the opposite party (which as a rule are from the past and already in the process of fading in memory). It doesn't work for Republicans however, you have to go back to Nixon for effective leadership and Nixon's faults are well known to us today -- from virulent racism, anti-Semitism to lack of regard for human life or even democratic principles. Hell, even basic honesty. And then if you want to go back to an overall last good President from the GOP, you'd have to pick Ike, and he was barely political to start with in comparison to most Washington politicians.|

Frankly, demanding pure perfection and refusing to give credit for "pretty damn good" seems to be the sort of hardline no compromise stance that leads to the sort of toxic political climate the US experiences - little different from GOP atttitides to Planned Parenthood even though no federal funding goes toward abortion.

So you can toot your horn about putting America first, but that's not really even believable at this point.While we're talking about why nationalist isolationism is ignorant and completely repulsive to anyone who knows any history beyond 2000, we need to talk about what happens when the US withdraws from global causes to put nobody at home in a better position. Countries with interests diametrically opposed to our own (China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, et al.) begin to fill the void. That's already happening with Paris and will continue in the exact same manner, abdicating leadership in the international community to people who don't have the county you live in's best interests at heart. It may not seem important now, but the little withdraws from leadership that happen over time are going to bite the US in the ass in the long run. When you alienate everyone and need help, there's nobody there to help you anymore, but fuck them to make the situation worse for people at home amirite. TL;DR: if you're not interested at all in helping the people at home as it stands, you don't need to cede leadership in the world to screw them any harder.Edit: Abdicating is a better word in this context than deferring.|

It also ignores the fact that your claim is just plain wrong. In 2012 for example, the U.S. government's $588 billion expenditure on means-tested programs and charity tax credits was more than triple private giving. As the Economist reported, in 2012 62% of funds given to Catholic charity organizations came from the U.S.  government - $1.5 billion over two years at the time.AIDS charity is high profile, so it's "lucky", because unpopular and unglamorous charities get fewer dollars.
